    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/4 cup warm water (110°F/45°C)</li>
        <li>1 cup warm milk (110°F/45°C)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
        <li>Glaze or sugar for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the warm milk, sugar, salt, eggs, and melted butter. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the yeast mixture to the milk mixture and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the flour, one cup at a time, mixing until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and turn it out onto a floured surface. Roll it out to about 1/2 inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Cut out doughnuts using a doughnut cutter or two different-sized round cutters. Place the cut doughnuts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Cover the doughnuts with a cloth and let them rise for another 30-45 minutes until puffy.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350°F (175°C). Carefully place the doughnuts in the hot oil, a few at a time, and fry until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Remove the doughnuts with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>While still warm, dip the doughnuts in glaze or sprinkle with sugar. Serve and enjoy!</li>
